## 🎯 About Me

- 💡 I'm currently learning **GitHub and version control** before diving into coding
- 🤫 I am 17 years old and I attend at Kenmont school and recently I started learning coding during my holiday period and hope to create a      website this following year! I live in Clairwood Durban. I will be in grade 10 this year. I have been working part-time as a social media marketing assistant from the 15th of December 2025 till the 9th of January 2026. In my spare time I have been learning software-devlopment, web devlopment and coding. Between the 17th of December and the 9th of January 2026 I learnt 3 modules in coding and completed one project. My first module was "Intro to Web and Hyper Text Transfer Protocal" with 8 chapters. The second module was "Approaching a Project and Version Control" with 8 chapters. The 3rd module was "Book Connect" it is a code along series.  What you are reading now is my first project. I had to create this as a project to reflect who I am as a developer.  Next I am going into Intro to Hyper Text Mark-Up Language Foundations. I hoped you liked it THANK YOU FOR READING!. Please save my details and share it with any begginer coders needing help with this. Coding is fun to do in spare time and helps you appercite the web-sites you visit more.  
- 🎓 Soon, I'll be exploring **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**!
- 🤖 I love problem-solving and working on creative projects.
- 🔥 Looking forward to building a real-world application.
